		<p>
			I am a 12 year old Tortie that lives in house in Bend, Oregon.  I live with 2 humans: Kristin and Chris.  They give me lots of love, food and 'treat treats' whenever I want them.  And sometimes when I dont want them!

			Being a cat in Bend is great.  I get to sleep all the time, watch birds from my 'judgement tower' and sometimes get to spend time out in the garden.
